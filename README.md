Generates posts using a markov chain.

Put each post on its own line in the corpus file.

In the corpus, replace newlines with " \n " (with the spaces). Double newlines can also be combined into the same word, " \n\n ". The spaces are important.

You can import the python file as a library, or run it on its own.
